				<h2>Here Comes Foxy</h2>
				<p>Foxycat will be a fresh start. Here are a few things I'm going to do differently.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Everything but important backups will be deleted and stricter control on what's stored.</li>
					<li>Run a git server for local repositories.</li>
					<li>Reduce power consumption.</li>
					<li>Utilize virtualization or containerization as much as possible.</li>
					<li>Learn another Linux environment.</li>

				<h2>What was wrong with Redcat?</h2>
				<p>When Redcat was created it fulfilled the roles it was created for. However that was 5 years ago, I use my computers differently. I've Lost interest in some hobbies and gained interest in others.ost interest in some hobbies and gained interest in others.</p>
				<p>Redcat had two goals.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Give me a place to learn about and enjoy Linux.</li>
					<li>Store files for siblings and myself. Mainly to watch pirated movies and tv shows.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Both goals are now irrelevant due to the passage of time. I've enjoyed linux so much that <span class="highlight">all</span> my computers run it now. I've lost interest in watching movies and TV shows, I've also moved out and no longer have siblings on the same local network. Australian internet has gotten slightly faster therefore the offline storage of movies and tv-shows is no-longer important.</p>
				<p>Redcat was running a poorly configured Ubuntu server that often required fixing. Redcat also had plenty of redundant storage totaling a usable capacity of 8tb. Because of the large storage capacity, it's filled up with useless junk. So much it's too time consuming to filter out.</p>
